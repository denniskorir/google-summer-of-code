#summary Google Summer of Code Knowledge Base Wiki

= Welcome to the GSoC Knowledge Base Wiki =

*Looking for information on using the Google Summer of Code web app or the program mailing lists?  Check out the [http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce/web documentation].*  You should also take some time to peruse the [http://code.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?topic=10442 program FAQs].

== Purpose of this Wiki ==
We've started this wiki to provide helpful advice for prospective and accepted Google Summer of Code^TM^ mentors and students, mostly composed by former mentors and students. Google's program administrators have also contributed to the wiki based on feedback we've received throughout the program's history.

Remember, this wiki is meant to provide guidance *only*.  What works well for one project may not work well for another, and each student's approach to the program will be unique. Further, each mentoring organization will need to create its own guidelines for participating in the program.  We hope the information provided on the wiki will be a useful starting point in drafting these guidelines, and we [mailto:gsoc@google.com welcome your feedback] about additional information that would be helpful.

The wiki is a work in progress, so if you see any sections marked "TODO" they will be gradually updated.  If you have suggestions for text for these sections, make sure to [mailto:gsoc@google.com let us know]. 

==Useful Links==
We've created a [http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/ blog for the program] for 2007, as well as [http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleSummerOfCodePodcasts program podcast].

Want to help spread the word about GSoC?  Some of our former students have translated our program [http://code.google.com/soc/GSoCFlyer07.pdf flyer] (pdf), so we're building a gallery of GsocFlyers.

If you're looking for more data on GSoC for 2006, check out the [http://code.google.com/soc/GSoC2006Statistics.pdf slides] from Chris Di!Bona's [http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8373 presentation] at [http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/ OSCON 2006].  You can also check out several posts about the results of 2006 program on the [http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/ Google Code Blog].  We had an 82% final success rate last year, meaning 82% of the 630 students who were accepted to the program received positive final evaluations.


==Advice for Mentors==
Wondering how to choose the best applicants for your project?  How to deal with a student reticent to post questions to the project-wide mailing list? How to keep your project's students engaged with the community long past the program's conclusion?  

Check out the AdviceforMentors page.

==Advice for Students==
Not sure how to choose the best mentoring organization for you? How to write an effective application?  How to approach dealing with your (perhaps super-famous) mentor?

Check out the AdviceforStudents page.

==More Help==
Interested in another perspective?  Have other topics you'd like to discuss?  We've created two public and two private mailing lists, one for all program mentors and one for students.  See the [http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/ Project Home Page] for a full list of all program mailing lists.

The purpose of the private lists is to give all program participants a place to communicate and seek advice from peers about any issues that may arise during the course of the program.  They are purposely closed so that this peer communication remains private and no one posting to these lists has to be concerned that any questions or discussions harm the relationship between mentor and student.  These two private mailing lists will open once student applications are accepted.

The Program Announcement mailing list and Discussion list will remain open throughout the course of Google Summer of Code.
