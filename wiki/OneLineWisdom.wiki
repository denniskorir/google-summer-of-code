Fellow mentors and friends,

If you had one suggestion for organizations who are new (or even not 
new) to GSoC what would that suggestion be?

My first suggestion would be:

"Mentoring fewer better students is usually better than mentoring more 
students because each student requires resources, and giving more 
resources to a smaller numbeer of better students tends to be healthier 
and more productive for both the project and the students."

That would be my "One line wisdom" to share, what would yours be?

Curiously,

Marty

The next suggestion I'd make is to make the students feel welcome,
integrated, important, and appreciated by treating them feel like any
other developer, through encouragement, taking sincere interest in
their efforts, and frequent constructive communication.

There was a session at the mentor summit last year closely related to
this idea that turned out to be a pretty interesting brainstorming
session:  http://googlesummerofcode.jot.com/EncouragingStudents

Communicate with your student frequently (about weekly).

I'd make that, "(at least weekly, more often is better)".

For mentoring organizations, "Set the bar high.  If you want quality  
applications, require enough detail in the proposal that the student  
can't just parrot the idea page.  A student who can't (or won't) do  
this isn't serious about working for you and you will only waste time  
on them that could better be spent on a student who wants to work for  
you."

For students, "Spend the time to write a good proposal.  It's more  
than just filling out a form.  A good proposal will require a lot of  
detail, so don't be surprised if the organization expects you to  
provide it.  If you have the background and experience to do the job,  
most of the detail will be just a matter of pushing the words onto  
the page, so it's not nearly as bad as you would think."

And to both, "Expect to iterate on the proposal.  Communicate,  
revise, polish, and clarify."
