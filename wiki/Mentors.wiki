#summary Mentors who students can contact any time throughout the year to get started

The best way to prepare for applying for mentoring programs like GSoC in the future is to become a contributor of the project that interests you ahead of time. The links below link to pages with some nice folks in each organization who can help you make your first contribution any time throughout the year.

Once you decide what project you are interested in contributing to and explore the information available about that project on its website and wiki, you can introduce yourself to the project's mentor and ask them any questions you have about contributing to the project. The mentor can help you build the project's code, identify an easy bug to start with, and help you with your patch for that bug. The mentor can guide you through your subsequent contributions and point to the resources for solving a particular task.

[http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/Irc IRC] is one of the main communication channels for open source projects. You should try contacting a mentor in the project's IRC channel, and use e-mail if you don't see them on IRC. Typically, there are other people in the project's IRC channel, who can help you too. You can address the mentor directly in the IRC channel by using their nick in your question. E.g. if the mentor's IRC nick is kelly, you can say "kelly: hi! I just built project-foo and looking for a bug to fix - I found bug 1234 and bug 4321 in the project's bug tracking system that both look like something I can try to work on, but I wanted to see if you have any recommendation, since you are listed as a mentor for the project".

There are thousands of open source organizations out there, and hundreds of them participated in GSoC in the past. For example, the full list of organizations that participated in 2011 is [http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011 here]. 

Please don't hesitate to explore an organization not listed on this page. Chances are you will find some clues about how to get involved on that organization's homepage. One approach is to look at the commit log of the project within that organization that interests you to see who are its most frequent contributors and follow their posts on the project's IRC channel and mailing list to learn more about the project. You can also ask any questions you have on the project's IRC channel and mailing list.

Organizations that are interested in providing one-on-one mentors year round can be added to the list by e-mailing Marina Zhurakhinskaya (marinazik at gmail) with a link to their list of mentors and a brief description.
